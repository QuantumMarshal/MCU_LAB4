## About the LAB 4: Flow and Error Control in Communication
This is the lab 4 of course Microcontroller - Microprocessor in HCMUT

**Instructor:** Le Trong Nhan

## Instruction
### How to get the exercises of the lab
Each exercises are in each branch have their name. For instance, exercise 1 is in Ex1 branch.

### Program requirement
STM23CubeIDE version 1.7.0 or above

Proteus version 8.10 or above

### How to run the exercise
**Each exercises contain:**
- .ioc (Config file using in STM32CubeIDE)
- main.c (the main file using in STM32CubeIDE)
- .hex (the hex file use for simulation in Proteus)
- .pdsprj (the schematic in Proteus)
- Ex_n_Schematic.PNG (the picture of schematic in Proteus)
- ConfigSTM32.PNG (the picture of config file in STM32CubeIDE)

**To build the project in STM32CubeIDE:**
- Make sure you download the ioc file or follow the sample represent in ConfigSTM32.PNG before build the project.
- After build the project, you will receive the HEX file in Debug folder

**To simulate in Proteus:**
- Download the project (.pdsprj)
- Make sure u already have the HEX file
- Right click to STM32F103C6 in Proteus and select edit properties
- Select HEX file
- Run the simulation
